 * OutStruct variables keep track of information relative to curl&apos;s
 * output writing, which may take place to a standard stream or a file.
 *
 * &apos;filename&apos; member is either a pointer to a file name string or NULL
 * when dealing with a standard stream.
 *
 * &apos;alloc_filename&apos; member is TRUE when string pointed by &apos;filename&apos; has been
 * dynamically allocated and &apos;belongs&apos; to this OutStruct, otherwise FALSE.
 *
 * &apos;is_cd_filename&apos; member is TRUE when string pointed by &apos;filename&apos; has been
 * set using a server-specified Content-Disposition filename, otherwise FALSE.
 *
 * &apos;s_isreg&apos; member is TRUE when output goes to a regular file, this also
 * implies that output is &apos;seekable&apos; and &apos;appendable&apos; and also that member
 * &apos;filename&apos; points to file name&apos;s string. For any standard stream member
 * &apos;s_isreg&apos; will be FALSE.
 *
 * &apos;fopened&apos; member is TRUE when output goes to a regular file and it
 * has been fopen&apos;ed, requiring it to be closed later on. In any other
 * case this is FALSE.
 *
 * &apos;stream&apos; member is a pointer to a stream controlling object as returned
 * from a &apos;fopen&apos; call or a standard stream.
 *
 * &apos;config&apos; member is a pointer to associated &apos;OperationConfig&apos; struct.
 *
 * &apos;bytes&apos; member represents amount written so far.
 *
 * &apos;init&apos; member holds original file size or offset at which truncation is
 * taking place. Always zero unless appending to a non-empty regular file.
 *
 * &apos;metalink_parser&apos; member is a pointer to Metalink XML parser
 * context.

 * This is the DES encryption function that gets called by just about every
 * other DES routine in the library.  You should not use this function except
 * to implement &apos;modes&apos; of DES.  I say this because the functions that call
 * this routine do the conversion from &apos;char *&apos; to long, and this needs to be
 * done to make sure &apos;non-aligned&apos; memory access do not occur.  The
 * characters are loaded &apos;little endian&apos;. Data is a pointer to 2 unsigned
 * long&apos;s and ks is the DES_key_schedule to use.  enc, is non zero specifies
 * encryption, zero if decryption.

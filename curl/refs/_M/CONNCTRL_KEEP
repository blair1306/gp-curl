 * Curl_conncontrol() marks the end of a connection/stream. The &apos;closeit&apos;
 * argument specifies if it is the end of a connection or a stream.
 *
 * For stream-based protocols (such as HTTP/2), a stream close will not cause
 * a connection close. Other protocols will close the connection for both
 * cases.
 *
 * It sets the bit.close bit to TRUE (with an explanation for debug builds),
 * when the connection will close.
